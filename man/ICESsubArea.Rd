\description{
Definition ICES SubAreas as they have been defined from 2018 inclusive.
}
\details{
Polygons are derived from shapefiles provided by ICES web-portals, and has been edited with some simplifications.
Notably detailed coast-lines have been removed, in favor of drawing area borders on land-mass.

Polygons are defined in WGS84 coordinates (unprojected).
