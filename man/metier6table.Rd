\title{MetierTable lvl 6 example}
\format{
\code{\link[RstoxFDA]{MetierTable}} with column 'gearcode' identifying gear codes used in Norwegian fisheries data (derived from NS 9400)
}
\usage{
data(metier6table)
}
\description{
Example of metier table for assigning fishing activity to Metier level 6, based on gear codes and mesh-sizes.
This is not a universal conversion table, but an example of a table made for a particular purpose.
Some gear assignments are done with assumptions, and considering the exact metier codes acceptable by data recipients.
}
\details{
For example it was agreed with data recipient that all bottom trawls should be reported as OTB, so paired trawl are explicitly grouped with otter trawls.

There are other examples of pragmatic code-mapping as well. This particular one was explained in order to caution against indiscriminate use.
The code example below annotates an activity census of COD-catches with FAO-gearcode declarations and target sepcies declarations, and compares the annotated metiers with the codes used for reporting catch where shrimp was declared as target.
