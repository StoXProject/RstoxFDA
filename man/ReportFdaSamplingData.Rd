  \item{Catches}{Number of catches sampled}
  \item{Vessels}{Number of vessels sampled}
  \item{WeightMeasurments}{Number of fished measured for weight}
  \item{LengthMeasurments}{Number of fished measured for length}
  \item{AgeReadings}{Number of fished with age determined}
  \item{WeightOfSampledCatches}{Total weight of the sampled catches}
