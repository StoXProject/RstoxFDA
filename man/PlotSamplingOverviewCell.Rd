\description{
Makes 'cell plot' overview of samples and landings.
}
\details{
Each part or 'cell' of the fishery identified by the groupingvariables of a \code{\link[RstoxFDA]{ReportFdaSamplingData}} report
is visualised as a cell on a two dimensional grid, and annotated with information about how much was landed in each 'cell'.
Cells that has been sampled are also annotated with a triplet (#vessels, #catches, #individuals) indicating the number of
sampled vessels, catches and individuals. The cells are also color coded to reflect how well they are sampled.

The visualisation gives an overview of which part of the fishery has few samples, and may suggest ways to group or post-stratify
variables for estimation. By extension it also suggests how supplemental sampling can be improved, for instance by revealing where
a small extra sampling effort prevents the need for grouping or post-stratifying.
The plot does not provide a direct visualisation of the efficiency of the sampling.
Efficient sampling may well leave many cells unsampled, as the activity (e.g. volume landed) may be very different between cells.

The color coding indicates five categories of sampling depending on how many vessels, catches, and individuals are sampled in the cell.
#'  The coloring is controlled by the arguments 'MinVessels', 'MinCatches', and 'MinMeasurements':
\describe{
\item{Good}{Cell has sufficient number of individuals, catches and vessels sampled.}
\item{Few vessels}{Cell has sufficient number of individuals and catches sampled, but not sufficient number of vessels}
\item{Few catches}{Cell has sufficient number of individuals sampled, but not sufficient number of catches}
\item{No samples}{Cell is not sampled}
\item{No Landings}{Cell is sampled, but there are no official landings recorded for the cell.}
}

See the documentation for \code{\link[RstoxFDA]{ReportFdaSampling}} for an explanation for why the category 'No landings' may occur.
The thresholds for what is considered sufficient sampling of vessels, catches and individuals, respectively,
is configured with the arguments 'MinVessels', 'MinCatches', 'MinMeasurements'

Colors are specified by ggplot convention and may be specified as a name (e.g. 'red'), a number (e.g. '2') or a hex-code (e.g. '#78c679').
