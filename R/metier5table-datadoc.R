#' MetierTable lvl 5
#'
#' Example of metier table for assigning fishing activity to Metier level 5, based on only gear codes.
#' This is not a universal conversion table, but an example of a table made for a particular purpose.
#' Some gear assignments are done with assumptions, and considering the exact metier codes acceptable by data recipients.
#'
#' For example NS9400 has codes for nephrops and shrimp trawls, and does not necessarilly distinguish pelagic shrimp trawls from bottom shrimp trawls.
#' Also the data recipient did not accept the FAO codes for nephrops and shrimp trawls,
#' so all of these gears are assigned to OTB, but target assemblage was set to either "DEF" (demershal fish) or "CRU" (crustaceans).
#'
#' There are other examples of pragmatic code-mapping as well. This particular one was explained in order to caution against indiscriminate use.
#' The code example below annotates an activity census of COD-catches with FAO-gearcode declarations and target sepcies declarations, and compares the annotated metiers with the codes used for reporting catch where shrimp was declared as target.
