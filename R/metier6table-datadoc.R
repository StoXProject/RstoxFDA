#' MetierTable lvl 6
#'
#' Example of metier table for assigning fishing activity to Metier level 6, based on gear codes and mesh-sizes.
#' This is not a universal conversion table, but an example of a table made for a particular purpose.
#' Some gear assignments are done with assumptions, and considering the exact metier codes acceptable by data recipients.
#'
#' For example it was agreed with data recipient that all bottom trawls should be reported as OTB, so paired trawl are explicitly grouped with otter trawls.
#'
#' There are other examples of pragmatic code-mapping as well. This particular one was explained in order to caution against indiscriminate use.
#' The code example below annotates an activity census of COD-catches with FAO-gearcode declarations and target sepcies declarations, and compares the annotated metiers with the codes used for reporting catch where shrimp was declared as target.
